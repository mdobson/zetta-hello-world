# Zetta Hello World

This is a sample zetta app with two mock devices, a sensor and an actuator.

##Sensor

Our sensor is a mock photocell.

##Actuator

Our actuator is a mock LED.

##App

Our app is a dusk to dawn lighting system that monitors the photocell. When the photocell indicates that it's dark the app turns on the light. When the photocell indicates that it's light then the app turns off the light.
